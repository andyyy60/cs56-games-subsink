* (a) (20 pts) A brief description of the project.  Here, I'm looking for a short description: probably 1 sentence, 2-3 at most.

  The project is a game called Subsink where the player is the pilot of a boat and the goal is to defeat and destroy the enemy submaries that are moving underneath the boat. The enemies can be defeated by dropping bombs from the boat. The boat can also be destroyed by the submarines with rockets that float towards the surface. The boat tha the player pilots has different speed settings and can more forward and backwards.

* (b) (20 pts) a set of user stories (as a X I can Y so that Z) that describe what the current software in its current state can do.
   As a player, I can drop bombs on enemy submarines
   As a player, I can move forward and backwards
   As a player, I can switch to different speed settings
  
    * First, review how [User Stories](https://ucsb-cs56

    * First, review how [User Stories](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/user_stories/) are supposed to be written.
* (c) (20 pts) a brief assessment of whether the software runs or not.   If it runs, briefly describe what it does
  The game compiles and runs. As an user I am able to run the game and play it without errors.
  
* (d) (20 pts) a set of user stories (at least 2, but you are encouraged to write up to 4 or more if you can, as many as you think is reasonable) about features that COULD be added to the software to make it more useful, fun, better, etc.
    * Again, review the preferred way to write [User Stories](https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/user_stories/).
    As a user, I can use my bombs to destroy enemy rockets
    As a user, I can move my boat with one keystroke instead of 6
    AS a user, I can throw bombs from the middle of the boat instead of two sides to reduce complexity
    As a user, I can make submarines explode instead of just dissapearing when they are defeated
    
* (e) (20 pts) An assessment of the current quality of the README.md.   What information could be added to make it easier for the next generation of folks maintaining this code to use the software, and/or maintain the software? 
  

* (f) (20 pts) An assessment of the current state of the build.xml file if applicable, or if the project has been converted to Maven or Gradle, note this.
   * If it's based on Ant, Are there targets that need descriptions?  Is there old legacy JWS stuff that needs to be removed?  (More on this below).
   * It it's based on Maven or Gradle, is there sufficient documentation in the README.md that someone new to those tools has the information they need to get started?
* (g) (20 pts) An assessment of the current "issues".  Are there enough issues that you could earn 1000 points by working on this project?   Are the issues clear in terms of what the expectations are?
* (h) (20 pts) A list of additional issues that you may have added, if any. For each, a link to the issue is good enough.
* (i) (100 pts) Most important: an assessment of the actual code.  Write a bit about how the code is organized.  Are the purposes of the classes, and their methods clear?  Is it obvious how the classes relate to one another?   Is the code easy to read and understand?   If you had to give someone else that was going to work on the code just "one screenful of text" to help that programmer get up to speed quickly, what information would you convey?
* (j) (40 pts) Related to code quality, but factored out into a separate issue because it is so important: how is the test coverage?   Are there JUnit tests at all?  If so, how much of the project is covered by testing?  Are there opportunities to expand test coverage, and if so, how would you go about it?-pconrad.github.io/topics/user_stories/) are supposed to be written.
